Purpose
~~~~~~~
!CCres converts Toolbox Resource files (type FAE, RESF v1.00 or v1.01) and
Wimp Template files (type &FEC) to and from text format.

Wimp application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Run !CCres by double clicking the icon. To convert either file type, simply
drag the file to the Iconbar, then drag the 'Save As' icon to a filer viewer.

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~
!CCres can be run without starting it as a wimp application by specifying
both the from and to file names on the command line, eg

*Run !CCres <infile> <outfile>

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CCres is 26/32bit compatible. It is now linked with the StubsG library, so
should no longer require the updated System files from Castle.

CCres can be run on RISC OS 3.10 or later using the latest Toolbox modules
available from the RISC OS Web site
<URL:http://support.riscos.com/Support/Updates/>

Text file format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Uses a simple C-like layout based on the equivalent OSLib header definitions.
Some entry names have been changed slightly to avoid duplication and ambiguity
where appropriate.

String entries may be enclosed in quotes to ensure that trailing spaces are
kept intact. CCres encloses strings in quotes by default, but they are not
obligatory.

The values for bbox, coord and cmp fields can be in the form of simple
mathematical expressions. The symbols ()+-*/ are supported, allowing
constructs like (100+50)/2 etc

Some possible uses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Gadget renumbering
* Aligning and resizing gadgets
* Add or review interactive help
* Simplifies language translation
* File compare of text format res files gives useful output!

NOTES
~~~~~
Res files created by !CCres may not be identical to !ResEd files:-
  * Relocation information is stored 'sequentially' (ie ascending address
    offset) by !CCres, but *not always* by !ResEd
  * !ResEd sometimes saves superfluous information, which is stripped out by
    !CCres (eg FileInfo, - data_and_time and file_size)
  * !ResEd saves button gadget validation_limit as 1 even if no validation
    string supplied. !CCres sets it to zero

Template files created by !CCres may not be identical to !FormEd files:-
  * When a string is truncated in FormEd, text beyond the new terminator is
    sometimes still saved in the file. !CCres ignores any text after the
    terminating charcter.
  
For these reasons a simple 'binary compare' of 'before and after' files will
almost always say they're different.
